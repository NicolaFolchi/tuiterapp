My Twitter app re-make


I created a twitter re-make app that is supported with a UNC Computer Science backend server. As of now, only students enrolled in COMP426 can interact with the database, which include tweeting, retweeting, replying, liking, editing and deleting tweets. 


TODOS:

- <del>Create my backend server so the application will sustain by itself and develop the login/register capability. </del>
- Prevent unauthorized users to access the application through the main url route.
- Keep sessions active for a period of time (cookie management).
- Implement password stretching
- Publish and host the application.
