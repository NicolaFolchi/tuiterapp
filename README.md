My Twitter app re-make


I created a simple twitter-like application that was first supported by a UNC Computer Science server. Previously, only students enrolled in COMP426 could interact with the database, which included tweeting, retweeting, replying, liking, editing and deleting tweets.

I wrote a node.js backend server to have control over the application. It will soon be hosted so that everyone can interact with it!
