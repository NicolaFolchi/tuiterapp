My Twitter app re-make


I created a twitter re-make app that is supported with a UNC Computer Science backend server. As of now, only students enrolled in COMP426 can interact with the database, which include tweeting, retweeting, replying, liking, editing and deleting tweets. 


TODOS:

Create my backend server so the application will sustain by itself and develop the login/register capability (in progress). 
Publish and host the application.
