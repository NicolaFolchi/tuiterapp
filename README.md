My Twitter app re-make


I created a twitter re-make app that is supported with a UNC Computer Science backend server. As of now, only students enrolled in COMP426 can interact with the database, which include tweeting, retweeting, replying, liking, editing and deleting tweets. 


TODOS:

- <del>Create my backend server so the application will sustain by itself and develop the login/register capability. </del>
- <del>Restrict non-logged-in users to access all routes. </del>
- Add routes for deleting own posts.
- <del>Keep sessions active for a period of time (cookie management).</del>
- <del>Implement password stretching.</del> (stretched for 300 ms.)
- Publish and host the application.
